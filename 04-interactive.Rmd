# Interactive Component

Select one (or more) of our key findings to present in an interactive format (D3). Be selective in the choices that we present to the user; the idea is that in 5-10 minutes, users should have a good sense of the question(s) that we are interested in and the trends weâ€™ve identified in the data. In other words, they should understand the value of the analysis, be it business value, scientific value, general knowledge, etc.
