Select one (or more) of your key findings to present in an interactive format. Be selective in the choices that you present to the user; the idea is that in 5-10 minutes, users should have a good sense of the question(s) that you are interested in and the trends youâ€™ve identified in the data. In other words, they should understand the value of the analysis, be it business value, scientific value, general knowledge, etc.
